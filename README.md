Model Selection Boosting

Model selection in machine learning involves choosing the best model from a set of candidate models to effectively capture the underlying patterns and relationships in the data.
Boosting is a powerful ensemble learning technique that combines multiple weak models, often referred to as "weak learners," to create a strong predictive model.

The theoretical process of model selection includes defining the problem, selecting the model class, choosing the evaluation criteria, and validating the final model using a test set to provide an unbiased estimate of the model's generalization ability.
